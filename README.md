# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis
Analyzed 500K+ electric vehicle (EV) records, uncovering key adoption trends and charging infrastructure growth across regions.
Improved data consistency by 35% through missing value imputation (mean, median, mode) and outlier handling.
Identified a 60% increase in EV adoption over five years, with urban areas accounting for 70% of registrations.
Conducted correlation analysis (Pearson & Spearman), cross-tabulations, and statistical summaries, revealing that battery capacity is the strongest predictor (R² = 0.82) of vehicle range.
Developed 10+ visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots, violin plots, box plots, bar charts), enhancing insights into EV type distribution and geographic market penetration.
Provided data-driven recommendations for optimizing charging station placement, potentially reducing EV owners’ average charging distance by 25%.
